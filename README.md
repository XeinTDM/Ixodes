# Ixodes
## Ticks are bad — this Ixodes is worse.

Nature’s Ixodes takes blood.  
This one takes data — quietly, efficiently, and without leaving a rash.

Rust-based recovery tooling that inspects browsers, messengers, wallets, and system artifacts on Windows hosts.  
Execution is orchestrated through `RecoveryManager` tasks and produces trace-friendly logs under `target/`.

## Usage
- `cargo build` / `cargo run` — build and execute locally.
- `cargo build --release` — produce an optimized executable.
- `cargo test` — validate recovery helpers and task registration.

## Status
- Closed development. No public contributions accepted.
